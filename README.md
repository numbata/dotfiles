# Dotfiles by numbata

These are my personal dotfiles for setting up a new system quickly and consistently.
They include configurations for macOS, terminal tools, SSH/GPG keys, and various development tools.

## Quick Start

Run this command to bootstrap everything:

```bash
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/numbata/dotfiles/main/bootstrap.sh | sh
```

This will:
- Install required tools (like Homebrew and 1Password CLI)
- Configure macOS defaults
- Set up terminal tools (e.g., tmux, Vim, WezTerm)
- Manage SSH and GPG keys securely

## Key Features

- **Mac Setup:** Automatically applies macOS preferences.
- **SSH/GPG Keys:** Securely managed via 1Password.
- **Development Tools:** Includes configurations for Git, Vim, tmux, and more.
- **Customizations:** Easily remaps keys and sets up tools like FZF, Dirvish, and Lightline.

## Notes

- Tested on macOS. Use at your own risk on other systems.

Enjoy your new system! ðŸš€
